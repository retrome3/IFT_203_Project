**Bello Mubarak | 2024/13199 | ICT 235 | Bells University**

## 1. Introduction
I made LearnSmart Tutoring, a website for connecting students with tutors. I chose this because many students need help with schoolwork, and I wanted to make finding tutors easier.

## 2. Research (What I Looked At)
Before coding, I looked at other tutoring websites like Khan Academy and Chegg. I noticed they all had:
- Clean, simple designs
- Mobile-friendly layouts
- Easy contact forms
I used these ideas but made my own original design.

## 3. How I Built It - Detailed

### 3.1 Planning Phase
I decided on 5 pages: Home, About, Services, Profile, Contact. I sketched the layout on paper first.

### 3.2 HTML Structure
I wrote HTML for each page with:
- Semantic tags (header, section, footer)
- Proper headings (h1, h2, h3)
- Forms with correct input types

### 3.3 CSS Styling  
I used:
- CSS variables for colors (helps with dark mode)
- Flexbox and Grid for layouts
- Media queries for mobile design
- Custom classes for consistent styling

### 3.4 JavaScript Functionality
I added:
- Theme toggle with localStorage
- Mobile navigation menu
- Form validation
- Interactive buttons

## 4. Main Features

### 4.1 Responsive Design
The website works on:
- Mobile phones (375px wide)
- Tablets (768px wide)  
- Desktops (1200px+ wide)

### 4.2 Dark/Light Theme
Users can switch themes. Their choice saves in the browser.

### 4.3 Interactive Forms
- Contact form validates email and name
- Booking form lets users select services
- Error messages help users fix mistakes

### 4.4 Professional Design
- Consistent colors and fonts
- Clear navigation between pages
- Accessible for all users

## 5. Challenges and Solutions

### Challenge 1: Mobile Menu
**Problem:** The menu didn't slide in properly on phones.
**Solution:** I used CSS transitions and JavaScript to add/remove a class.

### Challenge 2: Theme Saving
**Problem:** Dark theme reset on page refresh.
**Solution:** I learned about localStorage to save the preference.

### Challenge 3: Form Validation
**Problem:** Forms submitted even with wrong information.
**Solution:** I added JavaScript checks before submission.

## 6. What I Learned

### Technical Skills:
- HTML5 semantic structure
- CSS3 variables and responsive design
- JavaScript DOM manipulation
- Browser storage (localStorage)
- Form validation patterns

### Problem-Solving:
- How to debug JavaScript errors
- How to test on different devices
- How to break big problems into small steps

## 7. Conclusion
I successfully built a complete tutoring website that meets all assignment requirements. The project helped me understand how HTML, CSS, and JavaScript work together to create interactive websites. I can now explain every part of my code and why I made each design decision.
